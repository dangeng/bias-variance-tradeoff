# Visualizing the Bias-Variance Tradeoff

This is a repo for the script I wrote to visualize the bias-variance tradeoff, featured in [Machine Learning at Berkley's blog](ml.berkeley.edu/blog). 

`lwlr-visualize.py` is the script that I actually ended up using. Running it will generate jpegs of the graphs of the prediction, along with jpegs of graphs of the errors for different weighting neighborhoods. 

`index.html` is a quick webpage I threw together to test the animation.
